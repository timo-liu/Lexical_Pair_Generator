# Lexical_Pair_Generator

## Overview
The lexical pair generator is a tool for psycholinguists or any other researcher interested in generating semantically related but distinct words for the purposes of controlling for semantic effects or conducting research for which this type of semantic neighboring is relevant. This tool uses BERT to generate token level embeddings across a corpus of your choosing, and to extract semantically related words from sentences that you provide.
